# Check Settings App
Files from a presentation at Penn State MacAdmins 2018 on a beginner's guide to building an app from a script. Utilizes the program [Platypus](https://sveinbjorn.org/platypus) to take a script and turn it into an application to check settings.

The Applications folder contains the .app files generated by Platypus
The Scripts folder contains the final scripts being used.

Multiple files exists as these files were being used to demonstrate in a presentation the iterations I went through.
